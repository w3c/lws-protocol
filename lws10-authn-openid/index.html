      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document defines a mechanism for identifying agents and end users that plan to interact with a linked web storage server.
        This specification does not mandate a particular format for end-user credentials, though it does describe how existing identity systems can be used in conjunction with the linked web storage authorization framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        This document also covers a variety of security, privacy, internationalization, and accessibility considerations for ecosystems that use the technologies described in this specification.
