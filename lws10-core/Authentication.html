<p>
  This section defines a mechanism for identifying agents and end users that interact
  with a linked web storage server. This specification does not mandate a particular
  format for end-user credentials, though it does describe how existing identity systems
  can be used in conjunction with the linked web storage authorization framework.

  <h3>End-User Credential Data Model</h3>

  <p>
    The data model described in this section outlines the requirements for any
    concrete serialization of an end-user credential.
  </p>

  <p>
    An end-user credential MUST include tamper evident claims about a subject, including:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><dfn>subject</dfn> <strong>REQUIRED</strong> &mdash; an identifier for an end user. This MUST be a URI.</li>
    <li><dfn>issuer</dfn> <strong>REQUIRED</strong> &mdash; an identifier for the entity that issued the end-user credential. This MUST be a URI.</li>
    <li><dfn>client</dfn> <strong>REQUIRED</strong> &mdash; an identifier for a client application. This SHOULD be a URI.</li>
    <li><dfn>audience restriction</dfn> <strong>RECOMMENDED</strong> &mdash; a list of values that SHOULD include an authorization server identifier.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="authentication-validation">
  <h3>End-User Credential Validation</h3>
  <p>
    Validation of an end-user credential requires a trust relationship between the
    verifier and issuer of the credential. This trust relationship MAY be established
    through an out-of-band mechanism. Any additional mechanisms for establishing trust
    between a verifier and an issuer are outlined in specific authentication suites.
  </p>

  <p>
    An end-user credential MUST be signed. It is RECOMMENDED that the signature uses asymmetric cryptography.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="authentication-type-identifier">
  <h3>End-User Credential Type Identifiers</h3>
  <p>
    Each authentication suite MUST be associated with a token type URI. An authentication suite SHOULD use a URI defined in the IANA "OAuth URI" registry.
  </p>
