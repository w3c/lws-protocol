  <h3>Authorization Security</h3>

  <p>
    The recommendations described in Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security [[!RFC9700]] apply to this specification.
  </p>

  <section id="security-transport-security">
    <h4>Transport Security</h4>

    <p>
      An Authorization Server implementation MUST support TLS. When using TLS, the client MUST perform a TLS/SSL server certificate check, per RFC 6125 [[!RFC6125]].
      Implementation security considerations can be found in "Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)" [[!BCP195]].

  <section id="security-token-security">
    <h4>Token Security</h4>

    <p>
      Bearer tokens are vulnerable to theft and replay. Required mitigations include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Short Lifetimes: Tokens SHOULD have lifetimes of 300 seconds (5 minutes) or less
      </li>
      <li>
        Audience Binding: Tokens MUST be bound to a specific storage server via the <code>aud</code> claim
      </li>
      <li>
        Secure Storage: Clients MUST store tokens securely in memory when possible, never in localStorage, URLs, or logs
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="security-credential-protection">
    <h4>End-User Credential Protection</h4>

    <p>
      End-user credentials with unrestricted audiences MUST NOT be provided to untrusted authorization servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If an end-user credential issuer is unable to restrict the audience of a token, clients SHOULD use a mechanism
      such as OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange [[!RFC8693]] to create audience-restricted credentials before interacting with authorization servers.
