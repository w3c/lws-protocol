### Read Resource Operation
The [*read resource*](https://w3c.github.io/lws-protocol/spec/#dfn-retrieval) operation retrieves a [resource representation](https://w3c.github.io/lws-protocol/spec/#dfn-resource-representation) of an existing resource or the contents of a container. In other words, it is used to **fetch or access data** stored in the system. This operation covers both reading non-container resources and listing the members of container resources. All reads MUST interact with associated metadata resources as defined in Section 9.1, ensuring atomicity and inclusion of Link Sets [[RFC 9264]] for descriptions.

**Inputs:**
* **Target identifier:** The unique identifier of the resource or container to read.
* **Optional parameters:** These may include a *preferred format* for the response and/or a *partial range* specifier. For example, a client can request the resource in a specific format or ask for only a portion of the data (such as a byte range or subset), if the protocol supports it. The client might also indicate if it only wants metadata. For containers, parameters MAY include pagination controls or filters for metadata inclusion.

**Behavior:**
* If the target is a **non-container resource**, the server returns the content of that resource. If the client provided an acceptable format list, the server SHOULD honor it. If the server has multiple representations of the resource or can convert the resource to the requested format, it may return the resource in that format. Otherwise, if the requested format is not available, the server will respond with an error (indicating the format is not acceptable).
* If the target is a **container resource**, the server returns a representation of the container’s contents (a **listing of its member resources**). Instead of raw binary content, a container’s “content” is essentially the collection of references to its children. For containers with large memberships, servers MUST support pagination, returning partial listings with links to subsequent pages. Container listings MUST include metadata for each member, such as resource IDs (MUST), types as an array of system and user-defined (MUST), representations with mediaType and optional sizeInBytes (MUST for DataResources), modified timestamps (SHOULD). Servers SHOULD support JSON-LD framing for container responses, using a normative JSON-LD context and optional informative JSON Schema, with a media type like 'application/ld+json; profile="https://www.w3.org/ns/lws/v1"'. The server may format this listing in a suitable manner. By default, if no specific format is requested, the server might return a human-readable HTML or text listing. If a machine-readable format is requested and supported (for example, JSON, XML, or Turtle for RDF), the server can return the listing in that format. Listings MUST be ACL-aware, filtering based on client permissions to ensure privacy.
* The read operation also supports *metadata-only* access. For example, a client might perform a read request that asks for no body (just headers or metadata in HTTP, or an existence check). In such cases the server can respond with just the meta-information (like the fact that the resource exists, its last-modified timestamp, size, etc.) without sending the full content. This is useful for clients to verify existence or check for updates without downloading the entire resource.

**Possible Responses:**
* **Success:** The operation succeeded. For a non-container resource, the full (or requested range of) content is returned, along with relevant metadata (such as content type, length, and a version tag like an ETag or modification time). For a container, a listing of members resources is returned.
* **Not Found:** The target resource or container does not exist (or is not available to the client). The read operation could not be performed.
* **Not Permitted:** The client’s identity is known but they are not allowed to access this resource. The server refuses to provide the content. No details about the resource should be revealed in the response.
* **Not Acceptable:** The client requested a format or representation that the server cannot provide. The resource exists, but the server could not satisfy the `Accept`/format criteria.
* **Partial Content:** (If partial range was requested and succeeded, or for paginated container listings.) The server returns a fragment of the resource (with status indicating partial content). This would include appropriate headers indicating the range delivered and total size, or links to subsequent pages for pagination.
* **Unknown Error:** Some internal error occurred while trying to read the resource (e.g., a backend failure). The operation did not succeed, and the server signals a generic error.
