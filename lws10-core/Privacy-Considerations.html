  Credentials carry information about users and agents. While digital signatures can protect against tampering,
  it is possible for clients or third parties to read the values inside an unencrypted credential.
</p>

<p>
  As a result, credential issuers are encouraged to create tokens that contain only the information necessary for
  authentication or authorization, and to avoid including sensitive attributes unless required.
</p>

<p>
  In general, it is an anti-pattern to write unencrypted credential data to a log. In cases where this is necessary,
  implementations can truncate or hash a credential to preserve the privacy of the credential subject.

<p>
  When using pseudonymous identifiers in JWTs, a storage server may still be able to correlate requests from the same agent over time.
  To preserve user privacy in this case, a client application can request a batch issuance of JWTs where each JWT is used only one time.
  This does not prevent the storage server from using other information such as similarities in JWT content or originating IP address
  to correlate requests. When using pseudonymous identifiers, the authorization server will need to be careful not to issue the same identifier more than once.
