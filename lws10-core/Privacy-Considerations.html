  <h3>Authentication Privacy</h3>

  <p>
    End-user credentials carry information about users. While digital signatures can protect end-user credentials against tampering, it is possible for clients or other third parties to read the values inside an unencrypted credential.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result, issuers should create end-user credentials that contain only the information necessary for authentication. Avoid including sensitive attributes unless required.
  </p>

  <p>
    Implementations should not log the full contents of an end-user credential. If logging is necessary, tokens should be truncated or hashed.

  <h3>Authorization Privacy</h3>

  <p>
    Minimal Disclosure: Authorization servers should issue tokens containing only information necessary for
    authorization. Avoid including sensitive subject attributes unless required.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logging: Implementations should not log full token contents. If logging is necessary, tokens should be truncated or hashed.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using pseudonymous identifiers in JWTs, client applications should request a batch issuance of JWTs and each JWT should be used only one
    time against the storage server. This makes it harder for a storage server to use pseudonymous identifiers to correlate requests.
    This does not prevent the storage server from using other information such as similarities in JWT content or originating IP address
    to correlate requests. When using pseudonymous identifiers, the authorization server should not issue the same pseudonymous identifier
    more than once.
