  <h3>Authorization Privacy</h3>

  <p>
    Minimal Disclosure: Authorization servers SHOULD issue tokens containing only information necessary for
    authorization. Avoid including sensitive subject attributes unless required.
  </p>

  <p>
    Logging: Implementations SHOULD NOT log full token contents. If logging is necessary, tokens should be truncated or hashed.
  </p>

  <p>
    When using pseudonymous identifiers in JWTs, client applications SHOULD request a batch issuance of JWTs and use each one time
    only against the storage server. This makes it harder for a storage server to use pseudonymous identifiers to correlate requests.
    This does not prevent the storage server from using other information such as similarities in JWT content or originating IP address
    to correlate requests. When using pseudonymous identifiers, the authorization server should not issue the same pseudonymous identifier
    more than once.
