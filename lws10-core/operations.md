This section defines the four core operations that a Linked Web Storage (LWS) server **MUST** support. These operations manipulate resources and containers in a transport-independent manner, focusing on semantics rather than implementation details. Each operation specifies inputs, expected behaviors, and possible responses (outcomes). Responses include success indicators, resource representations (where applicable), and error conditions. Implementations **MUST** handle these operations atomically and consistently, meaning each operation either succeeds completely or fails without partial side effects. In case of errors, responses **SHOULD** provide enough detail for agents to understand the issue without leaking sensitive information. All normative requirements are to be interpreted as in \[[RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)\].

All operations MUST interact with associated metadata resources as defined in Section 9.1. Servers MUST distinguish between server-managed metadata and user-managed metadata, ensuring that operations do not alter server-managed metadata without explicit authorization. Metadata updates MUST be atomic with the operation and use Link Sets (RFC 9264) for description. Servers MUST support discoverability through self-descriptive mechanisms, avoiding hardcoded URIs. For read operations on containers, servers MUST support pagination to handle large memberships. Servers MUST support optional concurrency controls, failing with Conflict if the resource has changed since the client's last read. Partial updates (PATCH) are optional; if supported, they MUST use standards like JSON Patch or SPARQL Update for RDF resources. PUT for creation is not supported in this version to ensure server authority over naming; use POST for server-assigned identifiers.
